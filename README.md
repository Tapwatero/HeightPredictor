# HeightPredictor
Predicts height using only your mother's and father's height.

Most height prediction sites use the formula of both parents heights combined, add either 12.7cm for male or remove 12.7cm for female. However, by complete accident I did the removal and adding of 12.7 after dividing and so far this formula has been more accurate. Below I have attached a google sheet it has infomation of 4 unrelated people.
