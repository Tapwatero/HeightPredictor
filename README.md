# HeightPredictor
Predicts height using only your mother's and father's height.

Most height prediction sites use the formula of both parents heights combined, then add either 12.7cm for male or remove 12.7cm for female then divide.

However, by complete accident I did the removal and adding of 12.7 after dividing the heights and so far this formula has been more accurate.

Below I have attached a google sheet it has the heights of 4 unrelated people.

All the code in Main.java is annotated so feel free to ready through it and give new iterations to the code to improve it for everyone.
